## **Introduction**

**SHORTEE** started as a personal project, fueled by the need to create a clean, automated, and efficient way to manage and track URLs. At its core, SHORTEE was designed to solve a common frustration — managing long, untidy URLs that clutter communications. 

But, as the project developed, I realized it could be so much more than just a URL shortener. By integrating analytics, I wanted to empower users to gain insights into how their URLs are being interacted with — clicks, geographic locations, referral information — making SHORTEE a powerful tool for both personal and professional use.

## **Technologies**

### **Frontend**
- **HTML** and **CSS** for structure and styling
- **JavaScript** for client-side interactivity

### **Backend**
- **PHP** for server-side logic
- **MySQL** for database management
- **JavaScript** for client-side validation and dynamic updates

---

## **Architecture**
SHORTEE follows a simple yet effective architecture, designed with scalability and user experience in mind. 

- **Frontend:** Handles all user interaction and displays data.
- **Backend:** Manages the business logic, URL management, and analytics.
- **Database:** Stores user data, URLs, and analytics metrics.
  
This separation of concerns ensures that SHORTEE can scale effectively and is easy to maintain.

---

## **Frontend**

The frontend was designed with usability and aesthetics in mind. From the welcome page to the analytics dashboard, the goal was to keep things intuitive and easy to navigate.

### **Key Files:**
1. **`welcome.php`** - Introduces users and directs them to log in or register.
2. **`index.php`** - The main dashboard where users can shorten URLs, view analytics, and manage their links.
3. **`style.css`** - Defines the clean, modern look of SHORTEE, ensuring responsiveness across devices.

---

## **Backend**

The backend of SHORTEE is powered by a PHP-based API that handles all data requests and responses, ensuring smooth integration between the frontend and the database.

### **Key Files:**
1. **`db_connect.php`** - Handles the MySQL connection.
2. **`api_user_urls.php`** - API endpoint for CRUD operations on user URLs.
3. **`api_analytics.php`** - Fetches real-time data on URL interactions for analytics.

---

## **APIs**

SHORTEE’s backend exposes RESTful API endpoints that make it possible for users to interact with their URLs programmatically.

- **POST** `/api/shorten`: Shortens a new URL.
- **GET** `/api/expand`: Retrieves the original URL from a short link.
- **GET** `/api/analytics`: Provides detailed analytics on a URL.
- **DELETE** `/api/delete_url`: Removes a URL.

---

## **Setup Instructions**

### **Step 1: Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/short-url.git
cd short-url
```

### **Step 2: Configure the Database**
- Import `database.sql`.
- Update `db_connect.php` with your MySQL credentials.

### **Step 3: Install Dependencies**

## **Challenges and Risks**

This project came with its fair share of challenges. The biggest technical hurdle was creating an efficient analytics module that would handle click counts and referral tracking in real-time. Initially, I struggled with performance issues, especially with handling concurrent requests when the number of users increased.

I also faced difficulties when securing user data. Implementing HTTPS and robust authentication mechanisms added a layer of complexity, but ultimately made the project more secure.

**Future Iterations:**  
For future versions of SHORTEE, I would love to add:
- **Bulk URL Shortening**: Allow users to upload a list of URLs and get them shortened all at once.
- **Improved Analytics**: Provide more detailed analytics, including heat maps of click locations.
- **Customizable Branding**: Allow users to add their own branding to URLs.

Despite the challenges, I’m proud of the learning curve and technical depth involved in bringing this project to life.
